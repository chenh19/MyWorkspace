# MyWorkspace
*v0.0.1*  

## Introduction
[**Kubuntu**](https://kubuntu.org/getkubuntu/) has been my wife's least hated linux distro. This script is intended to configure the system after a fresh install.

## How to use
Simply copy the below command and run in [Konsole](https://konsole.kde.org/): 
```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenh19/myworkspace/main/setup.sh)" 
```
