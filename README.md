# MyWorkspace
*v0.1.1 (under heavy development)*  

## Introduction
This is an automated configuration tool for freshly installed [**Kubuntu**](https://kubuntu.org/), which is my wife's least hated linux distro.  
  
This tool will install and configure:
- [WeChat](https://www.wechat.com/)
- [EuDic](https://www.eudic.net/)
- [SnapGene](https://www.snapgene.com/)
- [IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/)
- [PyMOL](https://pymol.org/)
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
- [Krita](https://krita.org/)
- and more

## How to use
Simply copy the below command and run in [**Konsole**](https://konsole.kde.org/) (terminal): 
```
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenh19/MyWorkspace/main/setup.sh)
```
Or, there is also a simple [**tutorial**](https://chenh19.github.io/MyWorkspace/).
