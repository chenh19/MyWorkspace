# MyWorkspace
*v0.0.1 (under heavy development)*  

## Introduction
This is a configuration tool for freshly installed [**Kubuntu**](https://kubuntu.org/getkubuntu/), which is my wife's least hated linux distro.

## How to use
Simply copy the below command and run in [**Konsole**](https://konsole.kde.org/): 
```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenh19/myworkspace/main/setup.sh)" 
```
