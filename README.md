# MyWorkspace

## Introduction
This is an automated setup script after a fresh install of [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/getkubuntu/), which is my wife's favorite linux distro.

## How to use
**Simply copy and run:**  
```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenh19/myworkspace/main/setup.sh)" 
```
