Boot into the USB drive\n\nPress F12 when the computer is booting up\n\nSelect the corresponding UEFI boot option (e.g., USB HDD: Kingston) and press Enter\n\n\n\n3. Install Debian (KDE)\n\nOnce it logs in to Debian live session, open “Install Debian”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: (click to expand)\n\n\n\nIf “Install Debian” is not present on the desktop, you may also access it using the Application Launcher:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the language, then “Next”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the region and the zone, then “Next”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the default keyboard, then “Next”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect “Erase disk”, then “Next” (if you plan to install multiple OS on a single physical drive, you might select “Manual partitioning”):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the user account, then “Next”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: (click to expand)\n\n\n\nSince the release of Debian 13, password policies have become more stringent. However, if you need to set a shorter password (e.g., 6 digits), you may execute the below command in the Konsole (it will automatically exit once it’s finished) and try installing the system again:\n\n\nsudo sed -i '18,$d' /etc/calamares/modules/users.conf && exit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Install”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstallation might take some time (if it goes to sleep, the “username/password” for the live session is “user/live”):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce finished, it will prompt a restart:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Configuration\n\nConnect to internet\nCopy the below command, paste in the Konsole (terminal) and press Enter:\n\n\nbash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenh19/MyWorkspace/main/setup.sh)\"\n\n\nType your user password and press Enter to run:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: (click to expand)\n\n\n\nIf the text is too small in the Konsole (Terminal) before the scaling configuration, you may press Ctrl + + to make the text larger (this temporary setting will not be saved).\nIt will ask a few questions in terms of configuration preferences. If you didn’t notice immediately, it will simply pause and wait for your input.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. End\n\nAll done, enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\n(Windows-style dekstop layout)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Mac-style dekstop layout)"
